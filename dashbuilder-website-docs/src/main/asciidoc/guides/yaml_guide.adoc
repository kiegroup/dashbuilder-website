== Dashbuilder YAML Guide

[role="_abstract"]
This is a guide for creating dashboards and visualizations with YAML. You can run all examples with https://start.kubesmarts.org/[Dashbuilder YAML Online Editor].

=== Pages

A dashbuilder YML file should contain at least one page, hence this is the smallest YML that you can create (it renders a white page):

[source]
----
pages:
    - name: Hello
----

A page can contain rows, columns and finally components. A page with a single row and column can have the rows and columns omitted. Here's a page with a single component, which renders the text **Hello**:

[source]
----
pages:
    - components:
        - html: Hello
----
It is required to declare rows and columns for a more complex layout. Here's a page with two text in separated columns:
[source]
----
pages:
    - rows:
        - columns:
            - span: 6
              components:
                - html: Row 1 Column 1
            - span: 6
              components:
                - html: Row 1 Column 2
        - columns:
            - span: 6
              components:
                - html: Row 2 Column 1
            - span: 6
              components:
                - html: Row 2 Column 2
----
The YML renders to:

.Page Layout
image::guides/yaml/pageLayout.png[Page Layout]


The page, rows, columns and components can have properties, including some CSS properties, such as width/height, background color, color and more.

[source]
----
pages:
    - rows:
        - properties:
            background-color: darkgray
          columns:
            - span: 6
              properties:
                color: white
              components:
                - html: Row 1 Column 1
            - span: 6
              properties:
                color: lightblue
              components:
                - html: Row 1 Column 2
----

A column can also have rows with components, this is useful for more complex layouts:

[source]
----
pages:
    - rows:
        - columns:
            - span: 2
              rows:
                - columns:
                    - components:
                        - html: R1CL1R1
                - columns:
                    - components:
                        - html: R1CL1R2
            - span: 2
              rows:
                - columns:
                    - components:
                        - html: R2CL1R1
                - columns:
                    - components:
                        - html: R2CL1R2
            - span: 2
              components:
                - html: R2CL1R1

.Page Complex Layout
image::guides/yaml/pageComplexLayout.png[Page Complex Layout]

=== Datasets

There's a section for datasets where you declare your source of data. Dashbuilder supports multiple datasets types, but in this document we only cover JSON datasets, which does not require a backend.
JSON datasets can have as a source any JSON array with a reachable URL, so the simplest dataset declaration requires the uuid and the url.

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  url: /datasets/population.json
pages:
- name: DataSet sample
----

It is possible to declare inline JSON for testing and prototyping purposes:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
pages:
- name: DataSet sample
----

With a pure JSON array Dashbuilder will try to find the column type and give it a generic ID (Column X). You can override Dashbuilder's default settings using columns:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Name
    - id: Age
      type: NUMBER
pages:
- name: DataSet sample
----
The column must have a type which can be *LABEL*, *TEXT*, *NUMBER* or *DATE*. If no type is provided, then LABEL is used.

In most of the cases, the JSON format is not an array. For these cases it is possible to use the powerful transformation language https://jsonata.org/[JSONata] to transform a dataset using the `expression` attribute. In the following example the array of objects is transformed into a JSON array:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  expression: $.participants.[name, age]
  content: >-
            {
              "participants": [
                {"name": "William", "age": 33},
                {"name": "Luanda", "age": 32},
                {"name": "Anton", "age": 6}
              ]
            }
pages:
- name: DataSet sample
----

It is possible to use caching for non real time datasets. The cache expiration can be configured using `refreshTime`, otherwise the case is only invalidated when the YML runs again. Here's an example of a dataset cached for 30 seconds:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
  cacheEnabled: 'true'
  refreshTime: '30second'
pages:
- name: DataSet sample
----

Datasets can have the following fields:

* *Accumulate:* It is a new dataset field. When it's true, Dashbuilder keeps the data on memory on each refresh. It can be limited by maxCacheRows.

* *MaxCacheRows:* It determines the number of rows kept in memory when using cache or accumulate. The default value of this field is set to 1000.

* *Headers:* A map that is used to set headers that will be sent on the dataset HTTP request.

* *Query* A map with query parameters added to the dataset URL

* *Path* A path that is used on the dataset URL

=== Datasets lookup

To display a dataset Dashbuilder uses the concept of `lookup`. Imagine the dataset as a pie and lookups as a piece of the pie. With lookup it is possible to select which part of a dataset will be displayed.
The lookup is part of a special component called `displayer`, which is covered later on this guide. For now, consider only the table displayer.
The simplest use of a lookup is by simply providing the dataset uuid:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Name
    - id: Age
      type: NUMBER
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        lookup:
            uuid: mydataset
----

.Basic Lookup
image::guides/yaml/basicLookup.png[Basic Lookup]

With the lookup it is possible to define the number of rows and the row offset of a dataset:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Name
    - id: Age
      type: Number
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        lookup:
            uuid: mydataset
            rowCount: 1
            rowOffset: 2
----

The field order can be used to order the dataset based on a column. It is required to provide the column id and the sort order (`ASCENDING` or `DESCENDING`):

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Name      
    - id: Age
      type: Number
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        lookup:
            uuid: mydataset
            sort:
                - column: Age
                  sortOrder: ASCENDING
----

.Dataset Lookup with order
image::guides/yaml/orderLookup.png[Lookup with order]

A powerful dataset lookup feature is filtering. To use this capability it is necessary to provide the column, the filter function and the args for the filter. The supported functions are (in parentheses is the number of required parameters):

* IS_NULL(0)
* NOT_NULL(0)
* EQUALS_TO(1)
* NOT_EQUALS_TO(1)
* LIKE_TO(2)
* GREATER_THAN(1)
* GREATER_OR_EQUALS_TO(1)
* LOWER_THAN(1)
* LOWER_OR_EQUALS_TO(1)
* BETWEEN(2)
* TIME_FRAME(1)
* IN(1)
* NOT_IN(1)

The filters `TIME_FRAME` and `IN` are applied only for `DATE` columns and `LIKE_TO` is only for TEXT or LABEL columns.

Here's a `GREATER_TO` sample:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Name
    - id: Age
      type: NUMBER
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:        
        lookup:
            uuid: mydataset
            filter:
                - column: Age
                  function: GREATER_THAN
                  args:
                    - 10
----

.Dataset Lookup with filter
image::guides/yaml/filterLookup.png[Lookup with filter]

Filters can be combined using the AND logical condition, but it is possible to use logical operators AND/OR and NOT to combine filters:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: mydataset
  content: >-
            [
              ["William", 33],
              ["Luanda", 32],
              ["Anton", 6]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Name
    - id: Age
      type: NUMBER
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        lookup:
            uuid: mydataset
            filter:
                - function: OR
                  args:
                    - column: Name
                      function: LIKE_TO
                      args:
                        - "L%"
                    - column: Age
                      function: LOWER_THAN
                      args:
                        - 10
----

.Dataset Lookup with combined filter
image::guides/yaml/combinedFilterLookup.png[Lookup with combined filter]

Dataset lookups also allow grouping. The group section is where the column group and the group functions are provided. The columnGroup is used to specify the grouping column and the “groupFunctions” is used to specify the group function for each selected column. In the example below the dataset lookup sums the number of products per section:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: products
  content: >-
            [
              ["Computers", "Scanner", 5],
              ["Computers", "Printer", 7],
              ["Computers", "Laptop", 3],
              ["Electronics", "Camera", 10],
              ["Electronics", "Headphones", 5]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Section
    - id: Name
    - id: Quantity
      type: NUMBER
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        lookup:
            uuid: products
            group:
                - columnGroup:
                    source: Section
                  groupFunctions:
                    - source: Section
                    - source: Quantity
                      function: SUM
                      column: Total Products
----

.Dataset Lookup with group
image::guides/yaml/groupLookup.png[Lookup with group]

The supported group functions are `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN` , `AVERAGE` and `MEDIAN` for numbers. For label columns the supported functions are `DISTINCT`, `COUNT`, `JOIN`, `JOIN_COMMA` and `JOIN_HYPHEN`.
By default it uses the column name itself, it is also possible to give another name to the grouped column.
If a column is not specific in columnGroup, but used with other columns in columnFunctions, then the error  **Error during dataset lookup: No aggregation function specified for the column** is displayed.

Here's a summary of all supported group functions:

* *MEDIAN:* A group function for number columns and it calculates the median value.

* *JOIN:* It joins text/label columns using space.

* *JOIN_COMMA:* It is same as `JOIN` but uses a comma.

* *JOIN_HYPHEN:* It is same as `JOIN` but uses a hyphen.

However, it is possible to omit the column group section and use no function for columns under `columnGroup`, this way the columns will just be passed to the displayer

=== Displayers

Displayers are visual components that can show data. Dashbuilder supports by default all the popular charts types, tables, metrics with customized structure and style, data selectors to filter the whole visualization and finally external displayers, which are custom applications used to display data.

Dashbuilder consider as displayer every component with a settings, so when the settings is declared then the type must be declared as well (we can also use displayer instead of settings):

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: products
  content: >-
            [
              ["Computers", "Scanner", 5],
              ["Computers", "Printer", 7],
              ["Computers", "Laptop", 3],
              ["Electronics", "Camera", 10],
              ["Electronics", "Headphones", 5]
            ]
  columns:
    - id: Section
    - id: Name
    - id: Quantity
      type: NUMBER
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        lookup:
            uuid: products
----

*User data filtering*

All displayers can filter itself and filter others using filter capabilities. This is done using the “filter” attribute, the filter must be enabled and components that will be filtered must have notification on. Components can filter itself, here's a table filtering itself:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: products
  content: >-
            [
              ["Computers", "Scanner", 5],
              ["Computers", "Printer", 7],
              ["Computers", "Laptop", 3],
              ["Electronics", "Camera", 10],
              ["Electronics", "Headphones", 5]
            ]
pages:

            uuid: products
----

.Displayer with self filtering
image::guides/yaml/selfFilteringDisplayer.png[Displayer with self filtering]

To filter other components notification must be true and other components receiving the filter should have listening as true. Here's a table filtering each other:

          listening: true
        lookup:
          uuid: products
----

.Displayer with filter notification

*Refreshing data*

It is possible to constantly refresh a Displayer with data. In this case just declare a refresh with interval and the dataset will be retrieved each X seconds.

----
datasets:
- uuid: products
  content: >-
            [
              ["Computers", "Scanner", 5],
              ["Computers", "Printer", 7],
              ["Computers", "Laptop", 3],
              ["Electronics", "Camera", 10],
              ["Electronics", "Headphones", 5]
            ]
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        refresh:
          interval: 30
        lookup:
          uuid: products
----

NOTE: Bear in mind that smaller refresh intervals in multiple Displayers will impact the visualization performance.

*Columns formatting*

Displayers individually support dataset columns formatting. The field “columns” accept an array of columns where the id is provided, with it it is possible to change the column name, apply a number pattern and use Javascript to transform the column value. 
In the following example the column 0 is transformed to be upper case and the number column is formatted to use no decimal places

.Displayer with columns configurations
image::guides/yaml/columnsConfigurationDisplayer.png[Displayer with conlumns configuration]


*Table Settings*

When using the table displayer there are specific settings that can be used:

* *pageSize*: the quantity of items displayed per page;

Here's an example of these two properties:

[source]
----
datasets:
- uuid: products
  content: >-
            [
              ["Computers", "Scanner", 5],
              ["Computers", "Printer", 7],
              ["Computers", "Laptop", 3],
              ["Electronics", "Camera", 10],
              ["Electronics", "Headphones", 5]
            ]
pages:
- components:
    - displayer:
        table:
            pageSize: 3
        lookup:
            uuid: products
----

Displayers have the following fields:

* *PNG export:* the field png under export will allow users to export the displayer to PNG.

* *extraConfiguration:* A top level displayer additional configuration sent to the renderer. It varies according to the renderer. For example, the echarts option can be used sent in json format using this field.

* *subTitle:* A subtitle for the chart. It goes under general object.

* *allowEdit:* Under general object and allow users to modify data displayed on the chart.


=== Using Charts

In Dashbuilder the following charts are supported:

* *BARCHART*: with subtypes `COLUMN` (default) and `BAR`. It is also possible to use `STACKED` (`COLUMN_STACKED` and `BAR_STACKED`)
* *LINECHART*: with subtypes `LINE` (default) and `SMOOTH`
* *AREACHART*: with subtypes `AREA` (default) and `AREA_STACKED`
* *PIECHART*:  with subtypes `PIE` (default) and `DONUT`

All these types support one column for categories (X axis) and at least one column for Y axis. If this is respected, then simply changing the type will change the visualization. In other words, the following YAML will render a BARCHART:

The same configuration could be used with `AREACHART`, and `PIECHART` (only the first column is used for the pie values).

*Chart Axis configuration*

It is possible to configure charts X/Y axis using the axis configuration. 

Under the axis object there are two properties, x and y. Here are the supported attributes:

* *labels_show*: When true the labels will be displayed.
* *title*: A title for the axis.
* *labels_angle*: The label's angle. Only works for the X axis.

*Chart General Settings*

All charts and most of the displayers support chart general settings. These settings are part of the `chart` attribute:

* *width*: A number with the chart fixed width. It is not a CSS property;
* *height*: A number with the chart fixed height. It is not a CSS property;
* *resizable*: A boolean property that indicates that the chart  should auto resize according to the screen resolution. This is the only chart property that is supported by the Table displayer;
* *bgColor*: The chart background color
* *margin*: An object that configures the chart margin, it has the attributes left, top, bottom and right. It is not a CSS property;
* *legend*: An object that configures the chart legend. It has the attributes show, when true the legend is displayed, and position, possible values are: IN, RIGHT and BOTTOM.
* *grid*: An object to show/hide the grid, it has the boolean attributes x and y;
* *zoom*: When true will enable zoom on charts;
* *general*: In attribute `general` it is possible to set a title. The title will not be displayed, for this it is required to set the attribute show as true;

Here's an example using chart properties:

=== Selectors

Selector is a special displayer type used to filter the visualization. It has 3 subtytpes:

* `SELECTOR_LABELS`: Shows the values in selectable labels;
* `SELECTOR_DROPDOWN`: Shows the values in a dropdown;
* The default subtype is a select

NOTE: Filter must be enabled, otherwise selectors will not work. 

Here's an example of labels selector:

.Default Metrics

The HTML can be customized using the object `html` with the field html and `javascript` for javascript. Inside the HTML the variable `+${value}+` contains the value resulted from the dataset lookup and to refer to elements in javascript give the element the id `+${this}+` and refer to it in the javascript code. Be responsible for the javascript code used in the YAML!
Here's a basic example:

.Custom Metrics
image::guides/yaml/customMetrics.png[Custom Metrics]

Other variables from the displayer configuration can be used in the code (using `${variable name}` template): `title`, `width`, `height`, `marginTop`, `marginBottom`, `marginRight`, `marginLeft` and `bgColor`.

=== Meter Chart

A special chart is the meter chart. It compares values and shows the percent of the total. To configure the value's boundaries use the property `meter`, it supports the following attributes:

* *start*: a value to start the meter
* *end*: the max value for the meter
* *critical*: paints the meter as red if the value is bigger than this parameter
* *warning*: paints the meter as orange if the value is bigger than this parameter

For the dataset it accepts two columns: the label and the value. Here's an example:

=== Map

NOTE: Map is disabled for ECharts renderer and may be available in later versions.

Dashbuilder provides a Map component to show geographic data. It is country based, so to use it one must provide the country identification, which could be the country name, `lat, long` or the country code, and provide the value for that country. 
It has two types: 
* `MAP_MARKERS`: which marks the country with bubbles according to the value
* `MAP_REGIONS`: which paints the map according to the value.
The only specific configuration for map is `color_scheme`, which could have the values `red`, `green` or `blue` and it is an attribute of object map. Here's an example:

* **echarts**: ECharts chart. In this component the dataset is transformed to an echarts dataset and the `option` parameter can be used to provide a JSON object to configure the echart. We also parse the options in YML format to JSON, so some configuration could be done using pure YML. Here's a sample echart usage:

=== Navigation

It is possible to have multiple pages in a single visualization. The pages can be organized in a menu using navigation. When you don't declare a navigation then a standard menu navigation is used:

----
pages:
    - name: Cats
      components:
        - html: <h1> Cats </h1>
    - name: Dogs
      components:
        - html: <h1>Dogs</h1>
    - name: Tablets
      components:
        - html: <h1>Tablets</h1>
    - name: Laptops
      components:
        - html: <h1>Laptops</h1>
----


The section `navTree` is responsible for declaring the navigation tree and the navigation groups for the pages is possible to organize the menus in navigation groups. Here's an example:

[source]
----
pages:
    - name: Cats
      components:
        - html: <h1> Cats </h1>
    - name: Dogs
      components:
        - html: <h1>Dogs</h1>
    - name: Tablets
      components:
        - html: <h1>Tablets</h1>
    - name: Laptops
      components:
        - html: <h1>Laptops</h1>
navTree:
  root_items:
  - type: GROUP
    name: Animals
    children:
    - page: Cats
    - page: Dogs
  - type: GROUP
    name: Electronics
    children:
    - page: Tablets
    - page: Laptops
----

Navigation is an optional component and it is about the relationship between pages. When you have more than one page then a menu is displayed with all pages, you can organize this menu. Furthermore, navigation is the key for embedding pages inside each other.

NOTE: To show a default page just name it as `index` and it will be displayed by default, otherwise the default Dashbuilder page will be displayed.

=== Navigation Components
It is possible to embed pages using navigation groups. To do so Dashbuilder provides navigation components.

* *TILES*: Displays the navigation group pages in tiles;
* *CAROUSEL*: Displays the pages in a carousel;
* *TREE*: Displays a tree with the pages. It requires a target DIV;
* *MENU*: Displays a menu with the pages. It requires a target DIV;
* *TABS*: Displays tabs with the pages. It requires a target DIV;
* *SCREEN*: A component that shows other page. Uses it with: `screen: embedPageName`;
* *PANEL*: A component that shows other page in a collapsible panel. Uses it with: `panel: embedPageName`
* *DIV*: A div that shows the content for TREE, MENU and TABS components.

A property called `navGroupId` should be set to point to the same `groupId` declared in navigation. For components that require a div, then a DIV component should be placed on the page and the div ID should be referenced using the property `divId`.
Here's an example of navigation components:

[source]
----
pages:
    - name: Embed
      components:
          - html: This page was embedded using <strong>screen</strong> component
    - name: Panel
      components:
          - html: This page was embedded using <strong>panel</strong> component
    - name: Cats
      components:
        - html: <h1> Cats </h1>
    - name: Dogs
      components:
        - html: <h1>Dogs</h1>
    - name: index
      properties:
        margin-left: 10px
      rows:
        - columns:
          - components:
            - type: TILES  # try CAROUSEL
              properties:
                navGroupId: animals_group
        - columns:
          - components:
            - type: TABS  # try MENU or TREE
              properties:
                navGroupId: animals_group
                targetDivId: animals_div
            - type: DIV
              properties:
                divId: animals_div
            - screen: Embed
            - panel: Panel
navTree:
  root_items:
  - id: animals_group
    type: GROUP
    name: Animals
    children:
    - page: Cats
    - page: Dogs

=== Properties

The goal of properties is to make it easier to reuse YAML definitions and let users only customize certain parts of the document. Properties can be declared with a value and later references using `+${PROPERTY NAME}+`.

NOTE: Be careful when using `+${}+` to avoid conflicts with Metric templates.

Properties are meant to be used only with field values. Here's an example:

[source]
----
properties:
    My Property: <h1>Hello Properties</h1>
pages:
    - name: Cats
      components:
        - html: ${My Property}
----

When running on Dashbuilder you can also override the properties using query parameters. In the example above `My Property` could be changed using `+http://my.dashbuilder?My Property=New Property value+`.


=== Global

Global section was added in `0.26.0` version and it allows users to change the dashboard default mode to dark and declare a global settings for all displayers on the page or a global setting for all dataset or a global dataset:


[source]
----
global:
  mode: dark
  dataset:
    content: >-
      [
          ["A", 1],
          ["B", 2]
      ]
  settings:
    general:
      title: Common Title
datasets:
  - uuid: test

pages:
  - rows:
      - columns:
          - span: 6
            components:
              - displayer:
                  type: BARCHART
                  lookup:
                    uuid: test
          - span: 6
            components:
              - displayer:
                  type: LINECHART
                  lookup:
                    uuid: test
----
.Dark Mode
image::guides/yaml/darkMode.png[Dark Mode]

The supported global properties are:

* *allowUrlProperties:* When true then properties can be replaced using URL query parameters.

* *mode:* Changes the dashboard style. Can be *dark* or *light*. Default value is *light*.

* *settings/displayer:* Allow the users to define a common configuration for all displayers in the page.

* *dataset:* Allow the users to define a common configuration for all displayers in the page.
